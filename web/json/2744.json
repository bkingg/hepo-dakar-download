More often than not, dudes try to play like they never ever catch feelings, but then they go and perform some outrageous junk like hijack a plane to get touching their ex. When girls are clingy at the least it is simply, like, wanting that respond to their texts.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Really, talking about hijacking, one dude&#8217;s snarky Facebook standing got hijacked TOUGH recently.
